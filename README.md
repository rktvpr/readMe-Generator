# Description
This application is designed to generate a custom readMe file to the user by answering questions pertaining to the readMe. I learned how to use inquirer to write MD docs and how to start using Node.js and helped me become more familliar with the terminal.

# Installation
Inquirer is required to run this program

# Usage
To use this application run "node index.js" in the terminal. Once you have done this you will be prompted with 9 questions about your readMe.
